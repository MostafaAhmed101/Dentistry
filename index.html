                <h1>History of Dentistry</h1>
            <p>
                Dentistry is considered one of the oldest branches of medicine that has evolved over the ages, dating back to ancient civilizations that began with primitive attempts to treat dental pain using simple means. Over time, this field has witnessed remarkable developments, transforming from folk remedies into a comprehensive science based on advanced medical principles. Today, dentistry is regarded as one of the leading medical fields that combines prevention and treatment, providing people with healthy and beautiful smiles that reflect humanity's long-standing concern for oral health.

                <p>
                    During these early periods, not many divisions existed in the art of healing. Ailments pertaining to teeth and jaws were treated in a general manner, not requiring the services of a specialist. <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates
                        ">Hippocrates</a></span> , the Father of Medicine, was the first to give a scientific basis to understanding and treating diseases, before which anomalies were mainly treated by sacerdotal medicine. The cause of diseases was often attributed to superstitions requiring sacrifices and rituals to appease a supernatural power. One of the earliest cases was found in the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer
                            ">Sumerian</a></span> text, which describes 'tooth worms' as the cause of tooth decay. The <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation
                                ">Indus Valley Civilization</a></span> has yielded evidence of dentistry being practiced as far back as 7000 BC. A site in <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrgarh
                                    ">Mehrgarh</a></span> indicates that this earliest form of dentistry involved curing tooth-related disorders with bow-drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead craftsmen. The earliest dental filling, made of beeswax, was discovered in <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia
                                        ">Slovenia</a></span> and dates from 6500 years ago. It is logical that progress in dentistry would go hand in hand with the stability of a particular civilization, and the art of dentistry flourished in one of the oldest civilizations, the Egyptians.

                    The <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a></span> called the toothache 'ya-tongy' and classified toothaches according to their cause. They developed around 18 decoctions for toothache in the form of pills and mouthwashes. Along with these pills, they also used acupuncture as a means to treat toothache and gum diseases with about 26 puncture points for toothache and six for gum problems; some of these points were located at parts of the body distant from the oral cavity. They also used aromatic powdered leaves in a process called 'moxibustion' to relieve tooth pain.

                    Here, as in other countries, medicine and dentistry were practiced mainly by the sacerdotal caste, but not all the people in the caste were priests and doctors at the same time. There was a special class of people known as the '<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate
                        ">Phostophori</a></span>' whose mission was to cure the sick. As evidenced by the tomb of <span><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%8A_%D8%B1%D8%B9
                            ">Hesy Re</a></span>, who is often regarded as the first dentist, he stated, "the greatest of those who deal with teeth, and of physicians." This is the first known reference of a person being identified as a dental practitioner. The Egyptian text known as <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebers_Papyrus
                                ">Ebers Papyrus</a></span> talks about various ailments of the oral cavity and remedies for the same, including treatment for dental abscess, remedies to strengthen gums for swelling, and tooth pain. There were also attempts at replacing lost teeth, as discovered by archaeologists, with teeth united by a gold wire, some of which were from another individual.

            <div>
                <h3>The Arabians</h3>
                <p>The Arabians certainly had the merit of keeping alive the study of medicine in an age of decadence and barbarism. <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr_al-Razi">Rhazes</a></span>, or more precisely, <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr_al-Razi
                    ">Abu Bekr Muhammed ben Zacarjaer Rhazi</a></span>, stressed the need to exhaust every method to cure teeth before extracting them, hence propagating conservation of tooth structure. To prevent the spread of caries, cavities were filled with a cement made of mastic and alum, which is a laudable attempt at stopping the progress of tooth decay. Against periodontitis and the pains produced by it, he recommended, in addition to opium, oil of roses, pepper, and honey, as well as the scarification of the gums and the application of a leech. If, however, these remedies did not succeed, he applied castoreum, pepper, ginger, storax, opium, and other ingredients to the roots of the teeth. If even this method of cure failed, he touched the root of the diseased tooth with a red-hot iron or sought to provoke its fall by the use of special medicaments such as coloquintida and arsenic.</p>
                <p>((Ali Abbas)), in the eighth century AD, a <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Persian
                    ">Persian</a></span> physician, wrote about diseases of the tooth and explained the treatment of a periapical lesion by introducing hot needles into the tooth repeatedly until they became cool. He also used chemicals in the tooth like asafetida to devitalize the tooth and relieve the pain. If these methods failed, he would extract the tooth.</p>
                <p><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapion
                    ">Serapion</a></span> ((Jahiak Ebn Serapion)), who lived in the tenth century, indicated with great precision the number of dental roots. Against dental pains of phlogistic origin, he recommended bloodletting, purgatives, and many local medicaments. In cases of persistent odontalgia due to caries, he advised the application of opium in the carious cavity. To strengthen loosened teeth, he first employed astringents, and if these were of no use, he bound the loose tooth to the neighboring healthy ones by means of gold or silver wire.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest luminaries of medicine among the ((Arabs)) was <span><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86_%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7
                    ">Ebn Sina</a></span>. He was born in 980 AD and recommended drilling a tooth with constant pain to remove humors that had accumulated and filling them with medicaments.</p>
                <p> <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Zahrawi
                    ">Abulcasis</a></span> Abul Casem Chalaf Ben Abbas (1050-1122) was one of the greatest surgeons who recommended cauterization in cases of periapical abscess and fistula as well as described the process. His book contains one of the first representations of dental instruments. He also advocated ligation of teeth in cases of a blow or fall.</p>
                <h3 >Thirteenth to Fifteenth Centuries</h3>
                <p>During 1130-1163 AD, a change of guard occurred when a series of Papal edicts prohibited monks from performing any type of surgery, bloodletting, or tooth extraction. After the edicts, barbers assumed the monks' surgical duties. In 1210 AD, a Guild of Barbers was established in <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France
                    ">France</a></span>. Barbers eventually evolved into two groups: Surgeons who were educated and trained to perform complex surgical operations, and lay barbers or barber-surgeons, who performed more routine hygienic services including shaving, bleeding, and tooth extraction.</p>
                <p>
                    However, this was short-lived as in the 1400s - a series of royal decrees in <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France
                        ">France</a></span> prohibited lay barbers from practicing all surgical procedures except bleeding, cupping, leeching, and extracting teeth. In 1530, the "Little Medicinal Book for All Kinds of Diseases and Infirmities of the Teeth" Artzney Buchlein, the first book devoted entirely to dentistry, was published in <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany
                            ">Germany</a></span>.

These dentures were often crafted from materials like gold and silver, showcasing the Romans’ sophistication in dental care. While these prosthetics were limited to the wealthy and elite, their existence signaled an understanding of the importance of both functionality and aesthetics in oral health.</p>

                    The period of 175 years from 1800 to 1975 represents significant advancement in prosthetic and restorative dental service. The transition from the time of ill-fitting dentures, fashioned from naturally occurring materials, to the application of synthetic resins for a long list of dental and surgical purposes, described in this symposium, represents a typical example of technical and professional advancement that has taken place throughout world society during this same period. If dentistry retains this good working relationship, as it is expected to do, then the advancements within the next two generations can significantly change and improve the practice of dentistry from what is presently known, by applying additional new and modified dental resins.

                    Fauchard was the pioneer of dental prosthesis and discovered many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of ivory or bone and that these artificially-made dental pieces would be as useful as natural ones. One of his methods stated that the artificial teeth could be held in place by tying them to the remaining solid teeth by pivots, using waxed thread or gold wire.
